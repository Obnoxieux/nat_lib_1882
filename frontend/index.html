  <h1>Damascus Public Library Catalogue</h1>
  <p>
    This project provides a searchable database and REST API with
    the historical catalogue data for the Damascus Public Library
    after its founding in 1882.
  </p>

  <h2>University background</h2>
  <p>I majored in Islamic Studies (MA) in 2018. Part of my MA thesis was an analysis of a library catalogue that was
    created in Damascus in 1882. Back then, all previously independent collections of endowed books and manuscripts were
    collected and put together into a newly established public library, which later became the Syrian National Library
    after independence.
  </p>

  <p>The catalogue for this new library was a printed book detailing every single item and its provenance and therefore
    alluring for the study of the history of reading and scholarly life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in 2018 I compiled this (manually) into a LibreOffice Base database (having no clue about databases I used a
    single table) and used it for my research.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Situation</h2>

  <p>
    I now work as a software developer <a href="https://obnx.dev/" target="_blank">(my website)</a>, having left
    academia and the
    humanities behind. However, this project still holds a special
    place in my heart and provides me with a great opportunity to bridge my interests.

      <h3>Original Research</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      I doubt there is much value to be gained – but the original MA thesis as a result of my research on a
      subsection of this data is available for download.
    </p>
    <p>My thesis was written in German.</p>

  <h3>What I did here</h3>
  <p>
    I normalized the original Base documents and created a proper relational database in PostgreSQL for it.
    Then, I created a small web application to provide a searchable interface for the catalogue.

  <h2>Ways to query the data</h2>
  <p>
    There are two ways to query the data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the web interface (the site you are reading right now)</li>
    <li>Using the REST API</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For both, find usage instructions on the <a href="/manual/" title="User Manual">Manual Page</a>.</p>
